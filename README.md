These are a few of the projects i've created to help sharpen my Web Dev skills!

## Color Changer Site
This was the first site i coded that featured javascript, to add functionality to one of my sites. The project is pretty simple you click a button to randomly cycle between colors that are listed in an array. This then changes the background color of the page.

## Number Counter Site
This site uses javascript to enable functionality with the add, subtract and reset buttons. Also i used javascript to manipulate the HTML by increasing or decreasing the numbers.
